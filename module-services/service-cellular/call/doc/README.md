Call documentation
==================

MuditaOS's call library is able to perform:
- ingoring and outgoing calls
- perform call filtering
    - on RING (notification that there is incoming call)
    - on CLIP (notification on identified call)
    - based on contacts
    - based on phone mode

The call logic is one of the oldest functionalities in the OS, which has been changed multiple times in the past.
, therefore it has multiple visible (mis)conceptions. The current approach we want to keep is:
- Call handling logic should be in `CellularCall.hpp` -  it's an interface for ServiceCellular used to perform calls
    - Especially all actions changing call - i.e. hanging, acting upon CLIP/RING, or setting up audio
    - It's responsible for multicast specific call states to parties interested (i.e. call answered)
- Call UI should be in application-call - and only UI, there should be no more state handling then required to show UI
    - all actions that changes call - shoud be passed to CellularCall

**NOTE:** Historically lots of state keeping was done in application call, while quite a bit of logic was glued in ServiceCellular - this is a wrong way to go.


# library organization

This library's goal is to encapsulate the whole call flow/flows we can have.
It's end goal is to provide: actions and guards to write call state machine to asure full control over call processing.

Public API headers should be placed in `include/call/` catalog - these are exported in CMake to include paths for related libraries
All other headers should **not** be placed there. These are private internals of the library

# Call - how to write logic

CellularCall.hpp is written such as:
- CellularCall is state machine processor
- It has Call StateMachine inside and drives it
- API it requires is in `api` catalog
    - any API has to first define a virtual interface
    - then define platform implementation

State machine is written using [boost::sml](https://boost-ext.github.io/sml/index.html)

**NOTE** API catalog should and can be further split into API header and platform implementation.

# Call state machine

Call state machine can be generated with:
```
ninja call_uml
call_uml > call.puml
```

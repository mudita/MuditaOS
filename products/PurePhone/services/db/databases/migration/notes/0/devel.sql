An E Ink display and customized front light make reading more natural and less straining for the eyes. No more colorful icons that scream for your attention.

Uniform screen lighting makes the screen visible in direct sunlight and in the dark, with significantly reduced blue light.');

Minimalistic design for simple living. Designing Mudita Pure was a challenge. The more simple and clean we made the design, the more difficult it was to manufacture. It took us around 18 months to find the final look and included the creation of more than 40 different proposals. Yeah, yeah, maybe we overdid it. What can we say, we are perfectionists.');

We’re not blaming smartphones for all of the evil in this world, but the growing impact they have on our behavior, relationships, ability to focus and our health is alarming. Our private data, time and attention have become currencies that a number of tech and media companies compete for. Their products are specifically designed to keep us hooked, and we’re not very good at resisting.

At Mudita, we design devices that give you back the control over your privacy and relationship with technology. Phones should be a tool for connecting people, but overusing them isolates us. Smartphones can also do harm, to our sight and posture.

Mudita logo was inspired by a flower, a beautiful and vulnerable creation that needs to be protected. It is a representation of our heart, which can only bloom if properly nourished. Especially in todays modern world, which offers so many possibilities that make it easy to forget who we really are.

The lotus flower symbolizes something beautiful arising from the mud. Our logo could be interpreted as any flower or plant, as all of them symbolize life force, purity, true nature of our heart and Mother Earth. We think, in an age dominated by technology, not to forget about our origins and connection with all that is. It symbolizes the joy of existence in our beautiful world which unfortunately, our civilization tends to abuse so often.

Our logo has at least five different meanings, some a little less serious. We invite you to discover them. It probably has many more that we haven not found yet.');

The word ''mudita'' comes from Pali, a Middle Indo-Aryan language native to the Indian subcontinent and has no counterpart in English. We can describe it as pleasure, that comes from the unselfish joy of witnessing the well-being of others. We chose this name because we’re happy when you’re happy.

We were inspired by this Buddhist concept of developing a more compassionate relationship with yourself and others. Working on our ability to share the happiness of others helps us convert jealousy and worry into calmness and optimism.');

We believe that without constant distractions, it is easier to make room in our lives for amazing things! Our mission in Mudita is to make mobile phones and other devices that put your physical and mental wellbeing first.

We’ve reached a moment, where we refuse to be bombarded with more digital distractions, irrelevant information and excessive functionalities.

INSERT OR IGNORE INTO notes ("_id", "date", "snippet") VALUES (18, 1606831231, 'Lord Henry laughed. ''The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest contempt for optimism. As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have merely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that would be silly, but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being fashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I can.'' ''My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!'' said the lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. ''I have never been so happy. Of course, it is sudden--all really delightful things are. And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my life.'' He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked extraordinarily handsome. ''I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,'' said Hallward, ''but I don''t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement. You let Harry know.'' ''And I don''t forgive you for being late for dinner,'' broke in Lord Henry, putting his hand on the lad''s shoulder and smiling as he spoke. ''Come, let us sit down and try what the new chef here is like, and then you will tell us how it all came about.'' ''There is really not much to tell,'' cried Dorian as they took their seats at the small round table. ''What happened was simply this. After I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and went down at eight o''clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind. Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl! You should have seen her! When she came on in her boy''s clothes, she was perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk''s feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose. As for her acting--well, you shall see her to-night. She is simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the performance was over, I went behind and spoke to her. As we were sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each other. I can''t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can''t help it. Of course, our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own mother. I don''t know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to be furious. I don''t care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven''t I, to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare''s plays? Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear. I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth.'' ''Yes, Dorian, yes mate.''');

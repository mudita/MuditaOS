### Reporting bugs and feature requests

You can report bugs and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/mudita/MuditaOS/issues). This is also a good place to discuss architecture decisions and things that aren’t yet covered by the documentation. Please refer to the ["Contributing to MuditaOS"](./CONTRIBUTING.md) article for more details.

### Internationalization

If you want to start localizing MuditaOS interface please start from [the "Internationalization" article](./doc/i18n.md).

### Development workflow

When contributing code or documentation changes please follow the guidleines inside the ["Development workflow"](./doc/development_workflow.md) article.

## Documentation

For everything you need to kickstart your development environment please go to the [Documentation](./doc/README.md) on GitHub.

A fully detailed documentation can be build locally using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html).

### How to generate documentation using Doxygen

You can build code documentation with the following command:

```bash
./configure linux Debug
cd build-linux-Debug
make doc
```
If you prefer to build documentation always with `all` target instead, configure `cmake`
with `BUILD_DOC_WITH_ALL` option set to `ON`, e.g.:

```bash
./configure <target> <build_type> -DBUILD_DOC_WITH_ALL=ON
```

Documentation is generated in the `doc/html` subdirectory of the build directory. To view it open `index.html` using a web browser, e.g.:

```bash
firefox build-<target>-<build_type>/doc/html/index.html
```

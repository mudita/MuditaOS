## Documentation

For everything that you need to kickstart your development environment please go to the [Documentation](#) folder on Github.

A fully detailed documentation can be build locally using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html).

### How to generate documentation using Doxygen

You can build code documentation with the following command:
```sh
./configure linux Debug
cd build-linux-Debug
make doc
```
If you prefer to build documentation always with `all` target instead, configure `cmake`
with `BUILD_DOC_WITH_ALL` option set to `ON`, e.g.:
```sh
./configure <target> <build_type> -DBUILD_DOC_WITH_ALL=ON
```

Documentation is generated in the `doc/html` subdirectory of the build directory. To view it open `index.html` using a web browser, e.g.:
```sh
firefox build-<target>-<build_type>/doc/html/index.html
```

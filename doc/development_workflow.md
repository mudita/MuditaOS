# Development workflow

When submitting code or documentation changes please follow these steps to have bigger chances of getting your piece of work merged into the master branch.

## Create a new branch or fork

Create a branch or fork, which name is connected to the feature, bug fix, or documentation change you want to contribute e.g. `feature/some-feature` or `fix/some-fix`.

**Note:** If you're part of the MuditaOS core development team, please precede the branch name with a relevant Jira ticket number e.g. `EGD-5555-some-feature`.

## Commit changes

Each commit that makes it from your branch or fork into the master branch must have a title and a clear description.

If you're part of the MuditaOS core development team, your commit's title *must* start with a Jira ticket number in square brackets e.g. `[EGD-5555]`. 

Commits from the community will be accompanied by a relevant Jira ticket number during the merge. Don't add commits that are out of the scope of the Jira issue you are working on.
You should have exactly one commit in a single PR.

Your commit's subject line should be a single sentence describing what you are changing using present simple tense and an imperative mood. Please follow these rules:

- It must start with a verb. This sentence will be a part of the project changelog, so please ensure it will be clear to the non-technical readers. 
- If you are adding a new feature start with "Add"; start with "Fix" if you are fixing one.
- Don't use proper names such as names of classes or functions. 
- Try to be as concise as possible in the limit of 100 characters (including the Jira ticket number - 11 characters). 
- Don't end the subject line with a period. 

Then, in the commit message, you must include a short description of what the commit is changing in the project. You should be clear about
your motivation to do the change and how it influences the project.
Focus more on *why* than *how*.

An example of a correctly formatted commit:
```
    [EGD-4544] Change requirements for commits
    
    In order to be able to remove the obligation to change the project
    changelog with every PR, provide requirements for commits' title and
    description. The first sentence of each commit will be included in
    the changelog directly, while the rest of it should help understand
    others motivation and result of a change.
```

Here's [a helpful article about writing good Git commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

You can add a commit template and hook that will help with proper defining both branch name and a message title:

- [commit message template](quickstart.md#commit-message-template)
- [commit message hook](quickstart.md#commit-message-hook)

## Basic checks before Pull Request

Before submitting a Pull Request please go through some basic checks:

- test your changes on both Linux and RT1051 platforms (please pay special attention to the things you might break unintentionally, e.g. when working on calling, check call log too,
- run unit tests (`make check`),
- [run static analysis](static_analysis.md)
- check if your code formatting complies with [`.clang-format`](../.clang-format),
- whenever you add third-party software to MuditaOS source code, please make sure that the software component is added to a dedicated [section in `LICENSE.md` file on MuditaOS GitHub repository](../LICENSE.md) with a link to the text of the license where applicable.

As a part of our continuous integration process we will be soon introducing our own [test harness](../test/README.md).

## Submit a Pull Request

Submit a Pull Request. You can add labels that will help people who know the part of the code you are modifying in spotting the changes you are submitting and do a code review. 

Please use the PR description to:

- explain what and why you are changing, 
- what decisions you had to take, 
- what you have been considering but eventually did not do (if applicable), 

Include screenshots and gifs/screencasts if applicable. The more information you provide, the bigger chance that you'll receive a quick review.

**Note:** If you're part of the MuditaOS core development team, please precede the PR name with a relevant Jira ticket number e.g. `[EGD-5555] Fixed contact details`.

You also have to check if you comply with checkbox items - without them, you can't pass the CI checks. If it's not possible to check the checkbox (e.g. you can't write unit tests for documentation PR)
just check it anyway.
## PR review - answer questions

During a PR review, team members will ask you questions regarding your solution. Please answer them by explaining the reasoning behind the suggested changes. Even if the feedback you receive regarding your PR is an obvious change, please answer with a simple OK to show that you haven't missed it.

**NOTE:** do not close comments created by others without their clear approval. This makes reviewing PRs on github significanlty harder for reviewers.

## PR review - act on feedback

Add changes to your PR that are requested by reviewers and push the feature branch once again. Update comments requesting changes with a simple `Done`.

**NOTE:** Again: don't resolve a discussion on your own. Wthout clear agreement or approval, it's the reviewer's responsibility to do so.

## Pass the CI gate

All PRs are checked against a series of checks on CI:
- commit format
- filled up PR checklist
- whole PR clang style check
- compilations for every product in release with debug info or debug configurations for:
    - rt1051
    - linux targets
    - linux unittests

Passing the CI is a required element to be able to integrate the changes.

## Merge to `master` branch

When a PR is accepted by two or more reviewers it's time to add PR changes to `master` branch. **Merging to
`master` is prohibited - [do a rebase instead](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing). Do not add any commits to `master` that are not required - less is more. An ideal situation is when you have a single commit for a PR and a single Jira issue (MuditaOS core development team).** 

If you have multiple commits, you can squash them and force push a branch before merging your PR to master. **Please make sure that your commit message contains only valuable information.**

Merging a PR causes the feature branch to be deleted. Switch to master branch on your local machine and do a pull or fetch to get your changes.

**If you need any assistance do not hesitate to ask others üôåüèº**

### Commit using `git rebase`

**Git rebase works differently than Git merge.**

With `rebase`, you update your commits one by one.
```
git rebase origin/master  # will update your commits one by one to master.
```

To update it to the latest version of `master`:
```
git fetch                 # update remote branches on your local machine
git rebase origin/master  # update branch you are at to origin/master
```

**Git rebase works on an actual branch copy.**

`Rebase` changes your commit history (moves them on top). This means two things:

 - when you did a lot of changes in a lot of places - either `git push` your branch to the server, or make its copy
 - when you're happy of `git rebase` results - you'll need to push your branch with force to server - since you've changed its history (updated it) 

A minimal set of commands:
```
git fetch                                             # update all remote branches  
git status                                            # check if there are no changes dangling, or waiting to commit, no merge in progress, etc.  
git push origin your_branch_name:your_branch_name     # push your branch to server  
git rebase origin/master                              # update your local branch to origin master  

# while rebase not done
git mergetool                                         # if rebase didn't succeed it will ask to merge each commit it can't fast forward on top, othervise it won't happen  
git rebase --continue                                 # update of this commit to master is done, proceed  
git status                                            # when done - check that you have really done it  
# endwhile

# rebuild repository and check if your changes are intact
```

If there was something that broke your changes you can now either:

* fix it in your next commit
* try rebase again with:
    * `git reset origin/your_branch_name --hard`

If your rebase succeeds:

* `git push origin your_branch_name:your_branch_name`

**Note:**

 - Rebase changes history - don't rebase branches that other people are working on (it's doable, but don't do this if you're not familiar with how to do it properly)
 - Always rebase your feature branches to `origin master`

#### How to change some shameful commit somewhere in your PR branch history
```
git log -S 'shameful log I added'   # search in history when some message was added
git rebase COMMIT_SHA~ -i           # interactive rebase to commit sha I found in git log -S
# select option edit in interactive mode on commit that's wrong
# fix file that's wrong
git add FIXED_FILE                  # add your fixups (i.e. removal of the shameful log)
git rebase --continue               # continue with rebase
```

If you added a file that you didn't want to, you can use:
```
# instead fixing this file manually
git reset HEAD~ --hard
# or if you want to keep a part of the changes and add new changes:
git reset HEAD~
# then:
git rebase --continue
```

PS: A good GUI git browser will do it all for you.

# Products

In one source tree we have two products, short names in brackets:

* PurePhone ( Pure )
* BellHybrid ( Bell )

For simplicity, we have defined a few CMake targets that will create required images and update packages.

# Architectures

We support two target architectures:

* Linux x86_64
* RT1051

Some build targets are enabled/disabled based on the selected target architecture.

# Targets

For each product there are targets:


| Arch   | Name                        | Alias                                           | Description                                                                   |

## Product binary target

The software binary can be loaded by:
- JLink
- Directly onto the device by:
    - Updater utility
    - direct memory access

Devices in the field have security keys burned, therefore an additional step - binary signing will be required. Without the signature, devices will show a warning on boot.

## Disk image

Image of the software to be loaded onto the device memory. Has all necessary data to properly run the OS. 
The disk image can be built with additional, development assets. Please look for `WITH_DEVELOPMENT_FEATURES` for more information in make.

**All disk images can be inspected** to do so you can:
1. use `losetup` to add loop device for created image i.e.:
```
sudo losetup --show --partscan -f /path/to/file
```
2. mount listed partitions as required
3. remember to remove loop device after the use (where loopN is loop device created)
```
sudo losetup -d /dev/loopN
```

Or use `tools/mount_user_lfs_partition.py` which will do it for you.

## Update package

Tar-file meant to update software with the updater utility. It has all the necessary update assets and metadata.
Currently, the update package has all of the base data that should be on the device, though to make updates smaller, minimal updates packages, as well as gzipped packages should be easily possible.

## Check

Builds and executes all of the unit tests in the repository for the selected product.
Uses [download_assets](download_assets.md) to download unit test's required assets (fonts)

### Code coverage

To generate code coverage reports for unit tests, you have to configure the project
with `COVERAGE_ENABLE=ON`. Please note, that code coverage report generation
works for the Linux/Debug configuration only.
Code coverage reports are generated with the `gcovr` application. You can
install it with:
```
pip3 install gcovr
```

Following targets related to coverage report generation are available:
* `coverage-all-html` - run `ctest` and generate a detailed HTML report.
* `coverage-html` - generate detailed HTML report based on the data collected during last execution of a unit test. The report
will be generated in the `coverage-html` subdirectory of a build directory.
* `coverage` - same as above, but generate an XML Cobertura report instead of an HTML.



## json-common-target

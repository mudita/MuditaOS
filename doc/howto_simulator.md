# How to use Mudita Pure phone simulator

Mudita Pure phone simulator is a tool created to speed up developer work. Despite its limitations it's a good introduction to Mudita Pure GUI and selected apss and funcionalities of MuditaOS.

Some of the differences between the simulator and the actual phone are:
- you can't make phone calls or send text messages (unless you have a connected development board)
- it doesn't work fully as on the phone i.e. there are no visible E-Ink refreshes

You can start the simulator locally by executig the `PurePhone.elf` file located inside your build directory. 

You can also run the simulator on disk image with the same layout as we got on the phone by using `run_simulator_on_filesystem_image.sh`.

To move around the simulator please use the ["Keyboard binding on Linux Pure simulator" document](host_keyboard_bindings.md).

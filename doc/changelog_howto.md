# How to fill changelog entries

## This howto is based on [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## 1. The purpose of changelog:
To let the end user (not necesairly technically skilled) what your PR changes to him. This means if some spectacular crash has been fixed changelog entry should say eg. _Fixed system crash on saving SMS draft_.
On the other hand if several minor fixes or refactors has been made simple information is sufficent eg. _Minor fixes in Text widget_. Nothing deeply-technical - just information understandable by reader.

## 2. What to put in changelog
look at 1.

## 3. What not to put in changelog
eg. _Changed gui items according to last UI change_. This doesn't really explain anything. Also _Fixed crash on Sunday_.

## 4. When to fill changelog
Every PR. If PR contains multiple meaningful workpieces - list them.

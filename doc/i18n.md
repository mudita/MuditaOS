# Internationalization

## File and data structure

Currently all the wording used in MuditaOS interface is collected in the form of JSON files which are located in [the Image Assets folder](../image/assets/lang/).

The default fallback file for every language is currently the English version - `lang_en.json`

MuditaOS follows [Linux `date`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html) to format date and time. 

## How to start localizing the interface

1. Create an issue with the localization you want to start working on. Please use the following scheme: `[Language] localization [emoji_flag]` eg. `Polish localization ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±`. The emoji flag is a small detail that can help other community members in finding the localization they're interested in and helping you out in implementing it. Please make sure that the localization you want to implement has not been already implemented.
2. Add a `i18n` label to your new issue on GitHub.
3. Follow [the "Contributing to MuditaOS" article](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
4. As soon as you create a Pull Request with your localization we will review it and add it to the official MuditaOS distribution.

<p>THE EQUIPMENT MEETS INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPOSURE TO RADIO WAVES. The mobile phone is a radio frequency receiver/transmitter.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Mudita Pure has been designed to minimize exposure to radio waves (radio frequency electromagnetic fields) as defined by international guidelines, while maintaining signal integrity. These guidelines have been developed by an independent scientific institution (ICNIRP) and provide a basic safety margin to ensure the safety of all users regardless of age or health.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Exposure to radio waves is expressed in a rate called Specific Absorption Rate (SAR).</p></text>
<br></br>
<text weight='bold' size='32' align='left'><p>The maximum SAR value for Mudita Pure:</p></text>
<text weight='bold' size='27' align='left'>1,6 W/kg </text><text weight='regular' size='27' align='left'>(over 1 g) SAR Limit</text><br></br>
<text weight='regular' size='27' align='left'><p>American Standard ANSI C95.1 (ANSI 1992)</p></text>
<text weight='regular' size='27' align='left'><p>Head: 0,08</p>
<p>Body: 0,08</p></text>
<br></br>
<text weight='bold' size='27' align='left'>2,0 W/kg</text> <text weight='regular' size='27' align='left'>(over 10 g) SAR Limit</text><br></br>
<text weight='regular' size='27' align='left'><p>ICNIRP Guidelines 1998 (ICNIRP 1998)</p></text>
<text weight='regular' size='27' align='left'><p>Head: 0,08</p>
<p>Body: 0,08</p>
<br></br>
<p>During use, the actual SAR values for this device are significantly lower than those given above, because the power consumption of the mobile phone is automatically reduced if full power is not required to make a call, due to system performance and minimized network interference. The lower the power consumption of this device, the lower the SAR value.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Our solution uses 2 antennas with dedicated shielding and specially written software to minimize exposure to radio waves.</p>
<p>The antennas switch to the one with better parameters to minimize SAR, but also to keep  signal integrity. When scanning the network (what the modem does automatically) we get information which band has what signal level, comparing it to the maximum SAR values measured in a certified laboratory, we know which antenna to choose.  Due to the characteristics of the antenna, one works better in low bands, the other one in high bands. However, often in bands which operate together with good parameters, we choose the one with lower SAR. In the worst case scenario, we will not exceed 0.2 [W/Kg].</p>
<br></br>
<p>The SAR value of the phone was tested with the phone used at a distance of 0 mm. That is, right next to the head, as most people use the phone. Thanks to our patented solutions, you don't have to do anything to meet the requirements for exposure to radio waves when using the phone. However, we support what organizations, such as the WHO (World Health Organization) and the US Food and Drug Administration, have concluded, that the best way to reduce exposure is to use headsets, to keep the phone away from the head and body during conversations, and to reduce the time spent on making phone calls.</p>

<br></br>
<p>The phone has an internal antenna. Do not touch it. When using other accessories, make sure that the product you are using is metal-free.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The phone must comply with international guidelines (ICNIRP) or European Directive 2014/53/EU (RED) before it can be sold. The essential requirement of the guidelines and directive is the safety of the phone user and others.</p>

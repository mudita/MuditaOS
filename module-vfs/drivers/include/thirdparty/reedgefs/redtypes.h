/** @file
    @brief Defines basic types used by Reliance Edge.

    The following types *must* be defined by this header, either directly (using
    typedef) or indirectly (by including other headers, such as the C99 headers
    stdint.h and stdbool.h):

    - bool: Boolean type, capable of storing true (1) or false (0)
    - uint8_t: Unsigned 8-bit integer
    - int8_t: Signed 8-bit integer
    - uint16_t: Unsigned 16-bit integer
    - int16_t: Signed 16-bit integer
    - uint32_t: Unsigned 32-bit integer
    - int32_t: Signed 32-bit integer
    - uint64_t: Unsigned 64-bit integer
    - int64_t: Signed 64-bit integer
    - uintptr_t: Unsigned integer capable of storing a pointer, preferably the
      same size as pointers themselves.

    These types deliberately use the same names as the standard C99 types, so
    that if the C99 headers stdint.h and stdbool.h are available, they may be
    included here.

    If the user application defines similar types, those may be reused.  For
    example, suppose there is an application header apptypes.h which defines
    types with a similar purpose but different names.  That header could be
    reused to define the types Reliance Edge needs:

    ~~~{.c}
    #include <apptypes.h>

    typedef BOOL bool;
    typedef BYTE uint8_t;
    typedef INT8 int8_t;
    // And so on...
    ~~~

    If there are neither C99 headers nor suitable types in application headers,
    this header should be populated with typedefs that define the required types
    in terms of the standard C types.  This requires knowledge of the size of
    the C types on the target hardware (e.g., how big is an "int" or a pointer).
    Below is an example which assumes the target has 8-bit chars, 16-bit shorts,
    32-bit ints, 32-bit pointers, and 64-bit long longs:

    ~~~{.c}
    typedef int bool;
    typedef unsigned char uint8_t;
    typedef signed char int8_t;
    typedef unsigned short uint16_t;
    typedef short int16_t;
    typedef unsigned int uint32_t;
    typedef int int32_t;
    typedef unsigned long long uint64_t;
    typedef long long int64_t;
    typedef uint32_t uintptr_t;
    ~~~
